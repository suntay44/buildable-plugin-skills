## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-02

### Added

- Dependency-free `buildable` CLI: `plan`, `generate`, `init`, `review`, `check`, `list`, `eval`.
- Builder brain: 55 tag-routed archetypes plus data models, screen graphs, UI patterns, design playbooks, and quality rubrics.
- Five runnable golden starters: web task-manager, CRM, dashboard, marketplace, and mobile habit-tracker (Expo + NativeWind).
- Real plugin packaging: Claude Code plugin manifest + local marketplace with auto-discovered skills and `/buildable-*` slash commands; matching Cursor commands; Codex manifest.
- `review --build` runs typecheck/build; data-driven `expectedFiles` structure checks.
- `buildable eval` scores classification fixtures and context-load efficiency (~90% of context tokens saved per plan).
- Starter config single-source sync (`npm run sync:starters`) with a drift guard, version-pin guard tests, and a CI workflow that builds every runnable starter.
